# Design Teardown Project
Project based on the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown?ref=lnav) curriculum. The project involves creating a grayscale visual hierarchy heatmap of [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/). The goal is to focus on the visual, typographical, and design principles of the webpage, and to also practice positioning HTML elements on a page using CSS.
